When using the Code Search Engine, copy and paste the Python project you want to search inside this folder.
The search engine will index all .py files inside codebase/
and allow you to search for functions by name, docstring, or source code.

Example:
    codebase/
        your_project/
            file1.py
            file2.py
            etc..
